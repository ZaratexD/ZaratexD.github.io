**UW Applied & Computational Mathematical Sciences: Data Science & Statistics**

I am a Seniorstudying ACMS: Data Science at the University of Washington Seattle. I enjoy using programming as a tool to help me achieve my goals, express my creativity, and push the boundaries of cutting-edge technology like AI/ML.

Currently: Working at U.W. Dermatology Finance Department where I get hands on experience developing Dashboards, optimizing data pipelines, and communicating needs from Financial Analyst to iteratively make Financial reporting more streamlined.

I have taken a special interest in ML working on the DeepTracer\[<https://deeptracer.uw.edu/home>\] program with Data Analysis & Intelligent Systems (DAIS) \@ UW. Here we aim to bring Machine Learning techniques to predict protein structures pushing innovation in applied technology to life science.

Developing, planning, and working towards a common goal takes a lot of work. I am using my **GitHub** to showcase the skills I have learned and how they apply to the research I am assisting with as well as show my dedication to proper Software Development.
