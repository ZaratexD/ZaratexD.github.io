I enjoy using programming as a tool to help me achieve my goals, express my creativity, and push the boundaries of cutting-edge technology like AI/ML.\nCurrently: Working at U.W. Dermatology Finance Department where I get hands on experience developing Dashboards, optimizing data pipelines, and communicating needs from Financial Analyst to iteratively make Financial reporting more streamlined.\nI have taken a special interest in ML working on the DeepTracer[https://deeptracer.uw.edu/home] program with Data Analysis & Intelligent Systems (DAIS) @ UW. Here we aim to bring Machine Learning techniques to predict protein structures pushing innovation in applied technology to life science.\nDeveloping, planning, and working towards a common goal takes a lot of work. I am using my GitHub to showcase the skills I have learned and how they apply to the research I am assisting with as well as show my dedication to proper Software Development."
